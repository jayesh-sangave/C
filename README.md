# What is C?
C is a general-purpose, procedural, high-level programming language
# Inside the compiling process
1. Pre-processing
2. Compilation
3. Assembly
4. Linking

# Comments
single line Comments : //
<br>
multiline Comments : /* ...multiple lines... */

# Tokens in C
1. Keywords
2. Identifiers
3. Constants
4. Strings
5. Special Symbols
6. Operators

# Variables in C
1. data_type variable_name = value;    // defining single variable
2. data_type variable_name1, variable_name2;    // defining multiple variable
## There are 3 aspects of defining a variable:
1. Variable Declaration
2. Variable Definition
3. Variable Initialization
## Rules for Naming Variables in C
You can assign any name to the variable as long as it follows the following rules:

1. A variable name must only contain alphabets, digits, and underscore.
2. A variable name must start with an alphabet or an underscore only. It cannot start with a digit.
3. No whitespace is allowed within the variable name.
4. A variable name must not be any reserved word or keyword.
## C Variable Types
The C variables can be classified into the following types:
1. Local Variables
2. Global Variables
3. Static Variables
4. Automatic Variables
5. Extern Variables
6. Register Variables

## Constants in C:
The constants in C are the read-only variables whose values cannot be modified once they are declared in the C program.

Types of Constants in C:
1. Integer Constant
2. Character Constant
3. Floating Point Constant
4. Double Precision Floating Point Constant
5. Array Constant
6. Structure Constant
